- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @scratchingmyheadforideas. I use Trezor T and I went to check on my adalite wallet via the usual Trezor entry however, 
When I access my wallet the balance shows zero.  
What has happened? 
There is also no transaction history whatsoever.  
Am i missing something here, or is there a way to trace this now? Or does this mean i've been hacked and my crytpo been taken?
I conducted prior to this an update to Trezor T ( firmware one that is ). And usually use this method to access my adalite wallet rather then the mnemonic words. 
I beleive i also just tried Daedalus chekc too- but im unsure that this was done correctly. Took like 3 days to go through and check transactions with the blockchain.
 Does this sound right? Can anyone offer advice to help me?
